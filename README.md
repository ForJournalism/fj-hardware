* vibration (potholes, rough handling of packages)
* chemicals ((localized water (dissolved O_2 and pH) and air quality))
* biometrics (pulse)

### Output

* log file
* LCD

### Construction concerns

* calibration
* durability
* power
* reporting data

### Analysis

* error reduction
* ethics

### Case studies
