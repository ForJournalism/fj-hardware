The team from [Spark](http://spark.io) take us through using various sensors for collecting data. We also talk about calibration, ethical and durability concerns

## Syllabus

### Setup

* Getting started with the Spark Core (10 mins) *NOTE: Could use [Spark's existing video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxda0hXtJz8)?*
* Embedded systems 101: what is an Arduino, what is a Spark Core? (10 mins)
* Making a circuit on a breadboard (10 mins)
* Setting up a sensor and producing data (example: light sensor) (10 mins)
* Consuming and visualizing that data ([example: Google Spreadsheets](https://community.spark.io/t/example-logging-and-graphing-data-from-your-spark-core-using-google/2929)) (15-20 mins)

Intro: on a whiteboard, what types of things can I sense, what are some example use cases, and what sensors would I need? (10 mins)

Examples (5 mins each):

* light (done above, don't need to do separately)
* sound (decible meter for construction site, clapper) (10 mins)
* water (flood preparation, gardening)
* vibration (potholes, rough handling of packages)
* chemicals ((localized water (dissolved O_2 and pH) and air quality))
* biometrics (pulse)
* geiger counter (radiation)

Other issues to consider (one video, 10 mins total, whiteboard):

* Calibration
* Durability
* Power
* Noise
* Error reduction
* Ethics
